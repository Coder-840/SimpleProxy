# SimpleProxy
---
SimpleProxy is a simple, expirimental, PHP proxy. It is not finished, and may or may not be continued.
It can fetch and display with simple websites but often struggles with complex ones.
### Deployment
---

Deploy anywhere that supports PHP.
[Railway](https://railway.com) is a good place to deploy it.
There is an example [here.](https://simpleproxy-production-c702.up.railway.app/)
